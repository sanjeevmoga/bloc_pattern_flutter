# bloc_project

BLoC or Business Logic Component Pattern. The BLoC pattern allows for a seperation of the business logic of your application from your user interface by utilizing streams. We build all of our business logic with these streams which allows us to use Reactive libraries like RxDart. We can make streams which originate from the BLoC component and we can have streams that connect from the UI to the BloC.
